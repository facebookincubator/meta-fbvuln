# This class is used to generate a manifest of recipes used in constructing
# an image, their versions and any patched vulnerabilities (CVEs only at
# present).
#
# To use this class, inherit the class in your "local.conf" file. Inheriting
# this class adds a new task, "fbvuln_track",  to every recipe you build.
# Intended use, however, is not per recipe, but at the image level.
#
# How it works
# ------------
#
# As Bitbake builds your recipes, the "fbvuln_track" task records the recipe
# name (BPN), version (PV), CVE product name (CVE_PRODUCT, defaulting to BPN)
# and cleaned up version (PV up to the first "+" character) to a file in TMPDIR.
# In addition to the package identification data, the task inspects the sources
# of the recipe. Any vulnerability patches are tracked alongside the package
# identification (the extraction code is based on from the Poky
# "cve-check.bbclass").
#
# This class then hooks into image postprocessing, which allows us to run after
# package manifest file generation.
#
# We build a package map from the files in TMPDIR/pkgdata, which maps recipe to
# package name.  We build this in reverse as package name to recipe name.  We
# then augment this data from TMPDIR/pkgdata/runtime to pick up any aliases,
# PROVIDES packages and packages built with Debian library names.
#
# Once we have the package map, we read the image package manifest for the
# packages used in constructing the image and build a set containing the
# recipes used to produce the packages included in the image.
#
# We now iterate through the recipes tracked in the global tracking file that
# was built by the recipes.  We extract the original recipe name and version,
# product name, cleaned up version and the list of vulnerabilities from
# this file.  If the original recipe name is not in the set of recipes used to
# construct the image we discard the record.
#
# We now iterate through all recipes used in constructing the image and create
# a dictionary of CVE product name to vulnerabilities addressed by (cleaned up)
# version.  Where more that one recipe built the same version sources of a
# common CVE product we take the intersection of all patched CVEs as the set of
# patched CVEs.  This means we insist that all variants are patched (use-case:
# consider a custom busybox build for an initrd).
#
# Once we have all of this data, we write out a vulnerability check manifest
# containing the CVE product, cleaned version and a list of addressed
# vulnerabilities as a comma-separated line in the manifest.
#
# It is intended that this manifest file is then associated with your
# project's notion of a release so that you can later query released product
# versions, then get the manifest for those versions and submit them to
# vulnerability analysis.
#
# Usage

# Interit this class in local.conf:
#   INHERIT += "fbvuln-manifest"
